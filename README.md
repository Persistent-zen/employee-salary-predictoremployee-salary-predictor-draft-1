Employee Salary Predictor
Project Overview
This project aims to build an Employee Salary Predictor using machine learning techniques. It provides an interactive web application where users can input various employee attributes to get an estimated annual salary. The project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline, from data generation and exploration to model training, evaluation, and a basic interactive frontend.

Features
Synthetic Data Generation: Generates a realistic dataset of employee features and corresponding salaries for training purposes.

Comprehensive Data Analysis: Performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data distributions, relationships, and identify insights.

Robust Data Preprocessing: Handles categorical and numerical features, including one-hot encoding, ordinal encoding, feature scaling, and feature engineering (e.g., Skill_Count).

Multiple Model Evaluation: Trains and evaluates various regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to find the best performer.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Demonstrates hyperparameter optimization using GridSearchCV for improved model performance.

Model Interpretability: Utilizes feature importance and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to understand how different features influence salary predictions.

Interactive Web Application (React):

User-friendly interface for inputting employee details.

Provides estimated annual salary in both USD and INR.

Displays average salaries for the selected job position across different global locations for contextual comparison.

Optionally shows the average monthly cost of living for the chosen location.

Technologies Used
Backend (ML Pipeline)
Python

Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.

NumPy: Numerical operations.

Scikit-learn: Machine learning models, preprocessing, and evaluation.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization for EDA.

SHAP: Model interpretability.

Frontend (Web Application)
React.js: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.

Lucide React: For icons.

Getting Started (Local Setup)
To run this project locally, you'll need both a Python environment for the ML pipeline and a Node.js environment for the React frontend.

Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

Node.js (LTS version) & npm (or yarn)

Git (for cloning the repository)

1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/employee-salary-predictor.git
cd employee-salary-predictor


(Replace yourusername with your actual GitHub username)

2. Backend (Python ML Pipeline) Setup
Navigate to the backend directory and install the required Python packages.

cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt # You'll need to create this file manually


Creating requirements.txt:
You can create a requirements.txt file in the backend/ directory with the following content:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
shap


Running the ML Pipeline:
You can run each Python script sequentially to see the data generation, EDA, preprocessing, training, and interpretation steps.

python data_acquisition.py
python eda.py
python data_preprocessing.py
python model_training_evaluation.py
python model_interpretation.py


Note: These scripts are designed for sequential execution in a notebook-like environment. For a production setup, you would save your trained model and preprocessor.

3. Frontend (React Web App) Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory and install the Node.js dependencies, then start the development server.

cd ../frontend # Go back to the root, then into frontend
npm install
npm start


This will open the React application in your browser, usually at http://localhost:3000.

Important Note on Prediction Logic:
The React app currently uses a mockPredictor function that simulates the model's logic directly in JavaScript. In a real-world deployment, you would typically deploy your trained Python ML model as a backend API (e.g., using Flask or FastAPI) and the React app would make API calls to this backend for actual predictions. This project focuses on demonstrating the full ML pipeline and a basic interactive frontend.

Usage
Once the React app is running:

Fill in the employee details in the form fields.

Select multiple skills by holding Ctrl (Windows/Linux) or Cmd (macOS) and clicking.

Check the "Show Average Cost of Living" box if you wish to see that information.

Click the "Predict Salary" button.

The estimated annual salary will be displayed in both USD and INR, along with global average salaries for the selected job title and optional cost of living data.

Future Enhancements
Real Backend Integration: Deploy the trained Python model as a Flask/FastAPI API and connect the React frontend to it.

Advanced Model Deployment: Explore cloud-based ML deployment platforms (e.g., Google Cloud Vertex AI, AWS SageMaker).

Confidence Intervals: Display salary predictions as a range (e.g., $X - $Y) rather than a single point estimate.

Interactive SHAP Explanations: Integrate a simplified, interactive SHAP visualization directly into the web app to explain individual predictions.

Data Persistence: Implement a database to store historical predictions or user feedback.

More Robust Data: Integrate with real-world, larger datasets (e.g., from Kaggle or public APIs) if available and permissible.

User Authentication: For multi-user scenarios.
